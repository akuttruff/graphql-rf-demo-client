### Sample Apollo-React client for Renew Financial tech talk


This talk and the following code samples borrow heavily from [Eve Porcello](https://github.com/eveporcello)'s GraphQL Workshop. I have rebuilt the schema using types and queries relevant to my work at Renew Financial, where we build software to help make clean energy financing available to homeowners.
